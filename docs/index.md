# Introduction
This is the documentation of the IoT Data Space. The IoT Data Space is an effort
to create a data space for IoT data sharing. 

> Data spaces are emerging as a new form of digital platform aiming to liberate 
data from silos in order to enable data-driven innovations and shape digital transformation,

The IoT Data Space objectives are:

* Protect  sovereignty of data owners
* Preserve privacy of data owners, data subjects, and data consumers
* Provide interoperability at the data semantics level and at the data access API
level

## Enabling technologies
### NGSI-LD API
NGSI-LD API is an ETSI standard for data spaces. See more information [here](1_ngsi.md).

### Relationship-Based Access Control
Relationship-Based Access Control is a novel access control paradigm that considers
relationships between users and objects, as well as between objects themselves. See more information [here](2_rebac.md).
